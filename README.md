# Linear-Regression-Bike-Sharing-Case-Study

## Project Name
>* The task is to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes for BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider. As the company seeks to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, they need to understand the factors that influence bike demand in different conditions. The model will help identify which variables, such as weather, time of year, and other socio-economic factors, significantly impact bike usage. By analyzing these factors, BoomBikes can adjust its operations, marketing strategies, and pricing models to better align with customer demand once the pandemic restrictions are lifted.
>* The primary goal is to use the dataset, which includes meteorological and behavioral data, to create a predictive model that will assist BoomBikes' management in anticipating demand trends. Understanding how variables like temperature, season, and holidays affect bike usage will allow the company to prepare more effectively for future market conditions. The model will also serve as a tool for assessing demand patterns in new markets, enabling BoomBikes to expand and optimize its services in different regions based on local demand drivers.
